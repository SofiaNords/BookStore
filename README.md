# BookStore

This project is a **Database-First** application built using **WPF**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQL**. The application is connected to a relational database designed for a **bookstore**. The main objective was to develop an interface where users can interact with the database to manage inventory across different store locations.

### Key Features:
- **View Inventory**: Users can view the stock levels for books across various stores.
- **Add Books to Stores**: Users can add new books to store inventories by selecting from a list of books already available in the catalog.
- **Remove Books from Stores**: Users can also remove books from store inventories.

This application provides an efficient and user-friendly way to manage a bookstore's inventory while utilizing the power of **Entity Framework Core** to interact with the underlying SQL database.
